# Test coverage

To check test coverage you can run:

```
yarn coverage
```

You can see the coverage status at mainnet deployment [here](https://codecov.io/gh/liquity/dev/tree/8f52f2906f99414c0b1c3a84c95c74c319b7a8c6).

There’s also a [pull request](https://github.com/liquity/dev/pull/515) to increase the coverage, but it hasn’t been merged yet because it modifies some smart contracts (mostly removing unnecessary checks).
