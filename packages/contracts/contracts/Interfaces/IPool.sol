// Common interface for the Pools.
// @REVIEW: Most of the functions here are the same in all pools. Couldnâ€™t they be in an inherited contract? Like `contract ActivePool is Pool` and `contract Pool is IPool`... If we have different modifiers, we could implement them in the base contract as internal functions and then use external wrappers with the modifiers in the final contracts.
