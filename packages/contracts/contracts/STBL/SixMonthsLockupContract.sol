/*
* The lockup contract architecture utilizes a single SixMonthsLockupContract, with an unlockTime. The unlockTime is passed as an argument 
* to the SixMonthsLockupContract's constructor. The contract's balance can be withdrawn by the beneficiary when block.timestamp > unlockTime. 
* At construction, the contract checks that unlockTime is at least six months later than the Stabilio system's deployment time. 

* Within the six months from deployment, the deployer of the STBLToken (Stabilio AG's address) may transfer STBL only to valid 
* SixMonthsLockupContract, and no other addresses (this is enforced in STBLToken.sol's transfer() function).
* 
* The above two restrictions ensure that until six months after system deployment, STBL tokens originating from Stabilio AG cannot 
* enter circulating supply and cannot be staked to earn system revenue.
