/*
* The LockupContractFactory deploys LockupContracts - its main purpose is to keep a registry of valid deployed 
* LockupContracts. 
* 
* This registry is checked by LQTYToken when the Liquity deployer attempts to transfer LQTY tokens. During the first year 
* since system deployment, the Liquity deployer is only allowed to transfer LQTY to valid LockupContracts that have been 
* deployed by and recorded in the LockupContractFactory. This ensures the deployer's LQTY can't be traded or staked in the
* first year, and can only be sent to a verified LockupContract which unlocks at least one year after system deployment.
*
* LockupContracts can of course be deployed directly, but only those deployed through and recorded in the LockupContractFactory 
* will be considered "valid" by LQTYToken. This is a convenient way to verify that the target address is a genuine 
* LockupContract.
