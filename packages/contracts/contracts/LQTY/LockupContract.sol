/*
* The lockup contract architecture utilizes a single LockupContract, with an unlockTime. The unlockTime is passed as an argument 
* to the LockupContract's constructor. The contract's balance can be withdrawn by the beneficiary when block.timestamp > unlockTime. 
* At construction, the contract checks that unlockTime is at least one year later than the Liquity system's deployment time. 

* Within the first year from deployment, the deployer of the LQTYToken (Liquity AG's address) may transfer LQTY only to valid 
* LockupContracts, and no other addresses (this is enforced in LQTYToken.sol's transfer() function).
* 
* The above two restrictions ensure that until one year after system deployment, LQTY tokens originating from Liquity AG cannot 
* enter circulating supply and cannot be staked to earn system revenue.
