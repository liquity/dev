## TroveWithPendingRedistribution class

A Trove in its state after the last direct modification.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class TroveWithPendingRedistribution extends UserTrove 
```
<b>Extends:</b> [UserTrove](./lib-base.usertrove.md)

## Remarks

The Trove may have received collateral and debt shares from liquidations since then. Use [applyRedistribution()](./lib-base.trovewithpendingredistribution.applyredistribution.md) to calculate the Trove's most up-to-date state.

The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or create subclasses that extend the `TroveWithPendingRedistribution` class.
